The 'tinyfiledialogs.c' and 'tinyfiledialogs.h' files are unchanged.

These files make use of version 3.19.1 downloaded
from tinyfiledialogs official sourceforge.net page:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/






The CMakeLists.txt file was added by me to get the 
tinyfiledialogs source code to compile with the larger project (chip-8-cpp)
using CMake.

Feel free to use CMakeLists.txt file all you would like to utilize tinyfiledialogs with your project.
(Can't imagine anyone will, its kinda trash haha.)

Anyway, grab the official latest version of tinyfiledialogs from the official sourceforge page.
